### Using the template

Before publishing a new component make sure to replace:

- `NAZIV PROIZVODA`, `OPIS PROIZVODA`, product image, SKU link, and the "Original source" line in this README
- `version`, `description`, `url` in `idf_component.yml`
- `components:` name and `namespace:` in `.github/workflows/upload_component.yml`
- filenames in `src/` and `include/` plus matching `SRCS` and `INCLUDE_DIRS` in `CMakeLists.txt` and `#include` in the `.c` file
- dependency key in `examples/.../idf_component.yml` (path stays `../../..`)
- `@file`, `@brief`, `@param`, `@return` Doxygen comments in `include/*.h`, `src/*.c`, and `examples/basic/main/main.c` to describe the real API

Also make sure to add examples.

Run `./format.sh` before committing to auto-format `src/`, `include/`, and the example against the project's astyle rules (`.astyle_rules.yml`). CI runs the same check on every push/PR via `.github/workflows/format_check.yml` and fails on unformatted code.

For uploading to Registry you need to register a trusted publisher under a component. To make the release to the registry you must bump `version` in `idf_component.yml` to `X.Y.Z`, push that commit, and confirm Format Check + Build Examples both pass on it (Actions tab) before tagging. Only once both are green: `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`.

**Remove this section of README after everything is done!**
